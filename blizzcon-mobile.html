    <h1 class="case-title">BlizzCon Mobile</h1>
    <h3 class="case-subhead">BlizzCon is an annual gaming convention held by Blizzard Entertainment to promote its major franchises. The con features announcements, previews, esports, developer panels and a slew of other events, all of which can be attended in-person or virtually from around the globe.</h3>

<div class="case-content">
    <h3 class="title">Background</h3>
    <p>BlizzCon has an ever-evolving suite of support products for both in-person and virtual attendees. These include a website, mobile apps (iOS and Android), smart TV apps (tvOS and FIre TV), as well as a host of other tie ins to non-BlizzCon branded properties. <span>I joined the BlizzCon mobile team about 2 months into the BlizzCon 2018 business cycle with a mandate to reign in design scope and determine a vision</span> for that year’s iteration of the app. </p>
    
    <p>Compared to previous product teams I’ve worked on at Blizzard, BlizzCon was much smaller and about half of the team was comprised of outsourced engineers. Of the 4 internal Blizzard team members only myself and the tech lead had experience working with outsourced teams. This, combined with other factors, meant several inefficiencies and risks had crept into the early stages of the project. </p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Empowering & Enabling Through Process</h3>
    <p>After synching with each member of the team to assess the situation and understand pain points I set out to establish a formalized day-to-day process and cadence for the teams original 2 designers. In formulating this process I had two high-level goals. The first was to protect designers from disruptive ad-hoc requests, freeing them up to devote their time to research and feature design. The second was to create clarity for our PM around when development could begin on any given feature. I also worked with our tech lead on a plan to build a larger design runway as, at the time we both joined the project, design was at risk of blocking active development.</p>

<div class="case-content">
    <h3 class="title">Finding Our Vision</h3>
    <p>Once we had established a process that worked for the team we next had to ensure that the work being done in the process was the highest impact it could be. The product backlog for 2018 was a smattering of incremental improvements & bug fixes, scattered equally among all features with no particular prioritization.</p>
    
    <p>I worked with the project manager and tech lead to gather and synthesize the priorities of each BlizzCon business team (5 in total) and determine how the app could impact each, and to what degree. This was a highly collaborative effort that spanned multiple sessions involving the entire team. We used elements of design sprint methodology to structure these sessions around vision setting. These exercises also served to bring the team together and create internal alignment and trust.</p>
</div>
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/bcmobile-map.jpg" width="100%"></div>

<div class="case-content">
    <p>Historically the product had focused on in-person attendees and had been highly successful. So successful, in fact, that adoption among in-person attendees was approaching 100%. User satisfaction was high as well (based on BlizzCon’s annual post-con research findings).</p>
    
    <p>While we didn’t want to abandon the success we’ve seen with in-person attendees we made the decision to center our strategy around virtual attendees for the first time and focused heavily on improving content discoverability and consumption experiences. </p>
    
    <p>In order to ensure these efforts left us enough time and resources to make high-impact improvements and business critical updates we applied a 60-30-10 rule to our sprints (design/dev work would break down as: 60% new features 30% improvements to existing features and 10% bug fixes) with the understanding we would adjust as needed per sprint.</p>
    
    <h3 class="title">The Outcome</h3>
    
    <p>With a clear vision, trajectory, and internal and external alignment, the design team was able to do what it did best - create epic and impactful experiences for Blizzard’s players. As the team designed and iterated on features I worked to provide guidance and feedback, while managing relationships, advocating and defending work outside the team.</p>
