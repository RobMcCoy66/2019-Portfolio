    <h1>CubCadet.com</h1>
    <h3 class="case-subhead">Cub Cadet is a producer and global marketer of a full line of outdoor power equipment and services. In 2014 the company engaged Brunner to redesign their existing website to realign it with current business goals and customer needs.</h3>
</div>

<div class='case-hero' style="padding: 0px;"><img src="images/cub-case-hero.jpg" width="100%"></div>    


<div class="case-setup case-content">
    <h3 class="title">The Opportunity:</h3>
    <h3>Over the preceding several years an increasing amount of users reported online research and shopping as a key step in their journey to purchasing outdoor power equipment with brand websites cited as a primary tool.</h3>
    <h3 class="title">The Problem:</h3>
    <h3>Cub Cadet’s existing digital properties were designed for an audience consisting of dealers, retailers and certified technicians. These segments largely purchased parts, as opposed to the much larger segment of individual customers (looking to make a more expensive, one-time equipment buy) which Cub Cadet was targeting.</h3>
</div>
    
<div class="case-content">
    <h3 class="title">Understanding the Problem</h3>
    <p>Although the project was scoped with only a small research budget, the Cub Cadet marketing team was able to supply us with a number of resources including analytics, user segmentation, survey results and market data. They requested we augment these with competitive analysis to gain an understanding of the current market.</p>
</div>

<div class="case-image" style="max-width: 840px;"><img src="images/cub-competitive-analsys.jpg" width="100%;"></div>  
    
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>To supplement this data we ran some internal (unbilled) guerilla user tests of the current site. These task-based sessions focused on assessing the content & features of the site and how they impacted product discoverability (i.e. finding a mower for the subjects specific yard) for the new target audience. This helped create focus for the team and identify the high-level goals of the project.</p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Case Study: Architecture & Navigation</h3>
    
    <p>Our testing helped uncover a number of usability issues on the existing site, but
    the most apparent issue we saw was focused on the structure of the site. <span>Users were very quickly funneled to products, but in a way that gave them very little context into whether or not it was applicable to their needs</span>. In most cases we observed that the products users landed on were not relevant to the prompts given. i.e. “Find a walk behind mower for out house” would land the user on a product page for a snowblower or professional landscaping equipment.</p>
</div>    
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/cub-exisiting-site-1.jpg" width="100%"></div>    
   
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>Even in cases when users managed to find a product that was relevant to the prompt they generally weren’t aware they had. This was because the existing category, series and product pages consisted of  very technical sounding product names and descriptions.</p>
</div>
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/cub-exisiting-site-2.jpg" width="100%"></div>  
    
<div class="case-content">
    <h3 class="title">Attacking the Problem</h3>
    <p>To lower the barriers to product discovery we <span>reorganized the product catalog into buckets that created more clarity for the user, and used this grouping as a basis for a new site architecture</span>.  As an additional consideration we worked to align these groupings with industry standard categorization, which was a request from Cub Cadet. We also worked with our agencies Editorial team to rewrite product and category copy in a more user-friendly manner.</p>
    <p>A secondary goal of this effort was <span>condensing the overall architecture</span> to make it more streamlined and cohesive. The site had existed in several iterations for over approx. 10 years and had several different owners and priorities in that time. This led to a bloated and disjointed structure, with pages, video content and even entire other sites having been tacked on in throughout the architecture. This created confusing rabbit holes.</p>
</div>    

<div class="case-image"><img src="images/cub-card-sorting.jpg" width="100%"></div> 
    
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>Unpacking all of these factors required a high degree of collaboration with teams inside CubCadet, who were not directly involved with the project. To accommodate this collaboration we set up remote card sorting exercises utilizing Trello. This allowed us to work in real time or asynchronously as needed with all these various stakeholders, almost all of whom were located 300 miles away in Cub’s headquarters.</p>
</div>    

<div class="case-image"><img src="images/cub-architecture.jpg" width="100%"></div>
    
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>We used the outcome of this exercise to define a site architecture with the product categories as a foundation. We also created a clear callout for dealers and technicians, whom the site had historically served. This audience would be served by a new, separate site, in the future. The architecture also included considerations for seasonal needs which are a significant portion of Cub’s strategy.</p>
    
    <h3 class="title">The Outcome</h3>
    <p>In follow up user tests we observed a significant increase in successful results. <span>Task completion and time to completion each saw significant increases</span>. We also saw a much lower rate of error among users.</p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Case Study: Product Finder</h3>
    
    <p>While much of our efforts thus far had focused on customers  who had at least a passing familiarity with outdoor power equipment (i.e. people who were shopping to replace an existing piece or tool) <span>another goal of the redesign was to optimize the site to better serve customers at the very top of the funnel</span>. Essentially this referred to customers who were purchasing equipment for the first time.</p>
    
    <p>We again had a trove of inherited market research and learnings to help us understand this segment. We knew it was similar to the repeat purchaser segment in that they were primarily concerned with price and capability. <span>The key difference first-time purchasers was that they relied much more on evaluating products through the lens of their specific yard’s characteristics</span>. We also observed in testing that customers with no prior power equipment experience were focused on very high level information. This meant they were skimming pages quickly and backing out if they didn’t see what they needed.</p>
</div>
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/cub-user-quotes.jpg" width="100%"></div>    
    
<div class='case-content no-header'>
    <p>With this understanding we set out to identify the best experience to meet the needs of the first time buyers. We explored several options. The first of which was a dedicated section in the main nav for first-time buyers.</p>
</div>    
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/cub-product-finder-first-thought.jpg" width="100%"></div>    
    
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>We quickly realized once this idea left the white board that it began to fall apart. The complexities of the product catalog created and <span>untenable amount of overlap between options</span> that would be displayed on these pages. It also <span>didn’t allow users to combine factors</span> to narrow selections. </p>
    
    <p>Going back to the drawing board we explored several alternative ideas before landing on a 4-step product picker that allowed users to select high-level specifications related directly to their yards. These factors would then deliver a narrowed down product list to the user. Most permutations yielded 10 or fewer results. </p>

<div class="case-content">
    <h3 class="title">Additional Work</h3>
    <p>In addition to the research driven work covered above there were several “cost of doing business” improvements made to the site. These included things like SEO-friendly copy enhancements, making the site responsive and including areas to display advertising and promotions among other enhancements.</p>

    <h3 class="title">Outcomes & Results</h3>
    <h3><span>Product finder</span> became one of the most used features on the site and <span>was a significant factor in driving test drive bookings</span>.</h3>
    <h3>Optimized architecture and streamlined content led to a <span>dramatic improvement in search engine ranking</span> & click throughs.</h3>
    <h3>Overall <span>Lawn Tractor Sales Doubled</span> Within 1 Year.</h3>
