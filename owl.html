    <h1 class="case-title">Overwatch League</h1>
    <h3 class="case-subhead">Launched in January 2016, Overwatch League is a first-of-its-kind esports venture seeking to marry the world of competitive gaming with tried and true paradigms of traditional pro sports leagues.  
</h3>
</div>    

    
<div class='case-hero'><img src="images/owl-case-hero.jpg" width="100%"></div>    
    
 <div class="case-setup case-content">
    <h3 class="title">The Opportunity:</h3>
    <h3>A key pillar of the OWL business is content consumption (seperate from match viewership). Fans who consume non-match content outside of regular match times are more engaged and retain at a higher rate than fans who don’t.
    </h3>     

    <h3 class="title">The Problem:</h3>
    <h3>Unfortunately, while OWL was producing and distributing a high volume of content, fans either weren’t discovering it, or if they were, weren’t engaging with it.
    </h3>       
</div>   
    
<div class="case-content">
    <h3 class="title">My Role</h3> 
    <p> <p>I worked on the OWL mobile app through two major iterations. First, throughout 2017 and early 2018 I worked as an individual contributor on an MVP version of the app to support the launch of league’s inaugural season. The second phase began early in 2018 when I transitioned to lead design for the product with a mandate to improve existing features for our global audience while working with product and engineering to define vision and strategy for the product. The below work reflects my contributions from early 2018 on.</p>    
    <h3 class="title">Understanding the Problem</h3>
    <p>The first steps we took were to 1) examine <span>performance data</span> for content consumption in the app and other OWL properties and 2) to <span>perform a content audit</span> to gain a greater understanding of the overwatch league content landscape across mobile, web and social media. 
    </p>    
</div>    

<div class="case-image"><img src="images/owl-content-audit.jpg" width="100%"></div>    
    
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>We found that <span>although the league was producing a high volume of content, the vast majority of it was scattered across a decentralized and largely disconnected ecosystem</span>, which didn’t include the app or website. This was a problem because these platforms represented the leagues largest single user base. 
</p>
</div>    
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/owl-content-form-factor.jpg" width="100%"></div>    
    
<div class='case-content no-header'>
    <p>Compounding the problems with content discoverability was the fact that most of the content already available on high-traffic surfaces existed in a formfactor that wasn’t platform-appropriate. Most (and at times all) of the video content that existed in the app and website ranged in duration from 45 minutes to upwards of three hours. 
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="title">First Attempts</h3>
    <p>On the surface the solution seemed to be pretty cut and dry. If we work with the content strategy team to create more short form content and make sure it’s distributed to the app as well as social media. We quickly learned however the problem was more nuanced.</p>
</div>

<div class="case-image"><img src="images/owl-solution-first.jpg" width="100%"></div>    
    
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>While it was technically possible to push all league content to the app <span>the current interface wasn’t up to the task of displaying content in a useful way to users</span>. Due to tight timelines and shifting priorities during the initial product launch the content experience that shipped in the 1.0 of the app wasn’t able to be informed by the leagues actual content strategy as it was still being formulated.</p>
</div>    
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/owl-user-needs.jpg" width="100%"></div>    
    
<div class="case-content">
    <h3 class="title">Design Decisions</h3>
    <p>Armed with these learnings we decided to take the content aggregation experience back to the drawing board to completely reexamine how we were presenting content to users to better empower them moving forward. We worked with the content team to identify high-level buckets and a tagging strategy which could enable more useful aggregation in the short term while also providing a foundation to build on as the league evolved and we learned more about our users.
</p>
</div>    
 
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/owl-modules.jpg" width="100%"></div>    
    
 <div class="case-content no-header">
     <p>We designed a modularized UI supported by tag-based aggregation. This allowed us to present content based on the subject matter users cared about (as opposed to formfactor). The UI could be rearranged both dynamically as well as by user-set preferences. 
     </p>
</div>   
    
    
<div class='case-image'>
    <video width="100%" controls>
      <source src="video/test.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>  
</div>
    
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>Our initial release was scoped to include modules for all 12 teams (arranged by recency) as well as an evergreen module for sponsor content and non-team specific news. It also included a high-level “around the league” module which aggregation of content based on recency.</p>
    <p>This solution out performed the original design across the board. We saw a <span>23% increase in content engagement</span> across the board.  Additionally, over time the app <span>install base and week-over-week retention made significant increases</span> as well.</p>
    <h3 class="title">Improving the Video Experience</h3>
    <p>While the early results were encouraging we weren’t planning to stop there. We originally planned to iterate on the modular feed experience in the app by adding in support for the player and hero based modules outlined above. We also planned to add support for league-specific content (such as playoffs and all-star games).</p>
    <p>In the short term these features had to be pushed out due to external blockers. This being the case we made the decision to pivot our efforts from content discovery to increasing content engagement within the app (with the intent of working in parallel to unblock aggregation improvements).</p>
    <p>In short, although users were now able to find the content they cared about, once they did they were largely engaging with it and then immediately leaving - many times having only watched a portion of the video. Our goal was to generate more repeat engagement and curb exits from incomplete videos.</p> 
</div>
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/owl-v1-video-experience.jpg" width="100%"></div>
    
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>Our existing video experience consisted of a player, title, description (sometimes) and a swimlane of queued content. The player itself did it’s job, however the swimlane of queued content saw very little engagement. It was originally designed to give users a way to easily navigate between VoDs form individual matches, which are split into 4-5 separate videos all of which are several hours long. In a world where the UI was almost always populated by much different (and much shorter) videos we felt we could do better. </p>
</div>
    
<div class="case-image">
     <video width="100%" controls>
      <source src="video/VoD_experience.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>   
</div>
    
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>As it turned out, less is more. By removing the swimlane and reorienting the view as a vertical, locking scroll and revealing content inline we were able to create a less confusing more browsable experience.</p>
    
    <p>Due to technical limitations with our video player on android we were forced to revisit the proposed design and eliminate the need to have multiple instantiated video players in a single view.  We were able to achieve largely the same experience in android, however the designs were different enough that we decided to treat the divergence as a guerilla A/B test. </p>
</div>
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/owl-a-b-test.jpg" width="100%"></div> 
    
<div class="case-content no-header">
    <p>While both designs outperformed the existing experience by fairly wide margins. The <span>iOS version proved to be the more successful iteration</span> in both minutes watched and video plays. Armed with this information we began the process of working with the necessary external teams to unblock the implementation on Android.</p>
    
    <h3 class="title">Additional Video Improvements</h3>
    <p>Although these changes are fairly high contrast they were rolled out iteratively over several releases. In doing so the team was able to identify, prioritize and ship smaller highly-requested quality of life video features.</p>

<div class="case-content results">
    <h3 class="title">Outcomes & Results</h3>
