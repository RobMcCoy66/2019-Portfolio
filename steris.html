    <h1>Steris Expereince</h1>
    <h3 class="case-subhead">STERIS is a global leader in infection prevention, contamination control, surgical and critical care technologies, among other areas of focus. In 2015 the firm tasked Brunner with creating an interactive tool to assist their sales force in the field.</h3>
</div>  
    
<div class='case-hero' style="padding: 0px;"><img src="images/steris-case-hero.jpg" width="100%"></div>      

 <div class="case-setup case-content">
    <h3 class="title">Goal 1:</h3>
    <h3>Reduce sales team overhead of printing, bidning, updating & carrying copious amounts of printed product literature to client meetings.
    </h3>     

    <h3 class="title">Goal 2:</h3>
    <h3>Provide the sales team greater utility to answer common client questions regarding functionality and role poroduct play in hospital</h3>       
</div> 
    
<div class="case-content">
<p>After several discovery sessions the team, along with client stakeholders, landed on a concept that would become our final solution. Steris already had an existing sales tool, The Steris Experience, which Brunner developed and maintained as part of a previous project. This simple catalogue tool would provide a jumping off point for this project.</p>
    
<p>The goal of the new project was to rebuild this tool from the ground up, preserving (and improving) its current function as a catalog while incorporating expanded functionality including a free-roam 3d hospital environment, note taking, expanded presentation features and brochure / editorial content.</p>    

<h3 class="title">Primary Contributions</h3>
<P>I joined the team at the onset of the project as the primary UX designer. In this role I worked with a group consisting of one Project/Account Manager, two 3d Artists and one developer to research, concept, implement and test various features and functionality. My specific responsibilities included defining architecture, formulating task flows and researching, implementing and validating deisgn decisions through the lense of Steris' sales team and customers.</P>


<h3 class="title">Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge of this project was gaining access to potential users for research and testing purposes as STERIS’ sales force worked all over the country and the project’s budget didn’t support travel to achieve these goals. As a work around we were able to hold sessions with project stakeholders, many of whom have extensive backgrounds in sales as well as staff members from the agency who closely matched the sales force’s main demographics and level of technical proficiency.</p> 

<h3 class="title">Approach</h3>
<p>The project was split into parallel work paths. This allowed us to focus on the overall experience of the tool while simultaneously generating / gathering assets for the 3d environments. These paths crossed streams at various intervals to help solve mutual challenges.</p>
</div>

<div class="case-content">
<h3 class="title">Design Stories
</h3>
<p>Our first step was to define the primary functionality of the tool. We landed on navigating the 3D Walkthrough, viewing products, and taking notes. Once we had these defined I was able to formulate design stories to capture the actions users would need to take for each feature.</p>   
</div>    
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/steris-epics.jpg" width="70%"></div>  
    
<div class="case-content">
<h3 class="title">Task Flow</h3>
<p>With design stories in hand it was time to tie everything together. As we moved into formulating task flows, the overall architecture of the tool began to take shape. The 3D walkthrough would serve as the focal point for users, tieing the other features together. Essentially, at this stage, we realized what we were designing was equal parts app and video game.</p>    
</div>   
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/steris-task-flow.jpg" width="100%"></div>  
    
<div class="case-content">
<h3 class="title">3D Walkthrough</h3>
<p>At about the time work was beginning on task flows we were able to see the first prototypes of the 3D walkthrough. These prototypes (along with the final product) were comprised of 3d models designed in Cinema 4D and running on the Unity game engine.</p>    
</div>    

<div class="case-image"><img src="images/steris-models.jpg" width="100%"></div> 
    
<div class="case-content">
<h3 class="title">Designing A Controller</h3>
<p>While I was not involved in the day-to-day of this aspect of the project I did work closely with the 3d artists and developers to solve the problem of how the user would navigate and interact with the environment. I also had to contend with Bob and Tom hiding Star Destroyers in all their models.</p>
<p>To tackle the control issue we looked at a number of solutions ranging from simplistic 2-axis controllers from the 8-bit era of video games all the way up to 2-stick quaternion-based control schemes prevalent in modern consoles. We case the net even wider by investigating a number of iOS and Android specific games to see how we might provide the best solution for a touch interface.
</p>    
</div>
    
<div class="case-image"><img src="images/steris-controllers.jpg" width="100%"></div>

<div class="case-content no-header">
<p>We ultimately landed somewhere in the middle of the complexity spectrum. Our solution, which we nicknamed the gas pedal consisted of a single button and control stick. The button propelled the camera through the environment on a preset track while the stick allowed 2-axis for camera control. This led to some rework on the part of the 3d team as some of the environments needed to be adjusted to accommodate the track.

<div class="case-content">
<h3 class="title">Wireframes</h3>
<p>The next step was to visualize our task flow. To accomplish this I compiled detailed wireframes. These began as simple pen and paper sketches before being developed into more polished documentation. Work was completed in close collaboration with the 3D and Development team members in order to avoid any possible technical roadblocks that may arise from Unity.</p>   
</div>

<div class="case-content">
<h3 class="title">The Final Product</h3>  
<p>The final step was design a UI around the approved wireframes. The only concrete rules we were given in terms of branding were to utilize the client's blue and their logo, the rest was up to us. With that in mind we opted to a clean and minimal approach. This gave the tool a longer shelf life in terms of brand fidelity as well as allowing for increased visual focus on, products and the 3d environments.</p>

<h3 class="title">Project Reflections</h3>
<p>We unveiled the tool in March of 2015 at Steris’ annual sales conference in Orlando where we led several onboarding and training sessions with the sales force.The response was overwhelmingly positive. We began to receive our first meaningful feedback a few weeks later when the devices were shipped and the tool began to be used in the field. Though we weren’t scoped to track any analytics we did receive and aggregate on-going qualitative feedback from the sales team. This feedback has led to some minor usability and technical tweaks as well as larger discussions about added functionality and features, some of which are currently in development.</p>
<p>Internally, the tool was used as a presentation piece in pursuing other work. It has also served as a bit of a sandbox for the 3D team to make various ventures into VR and 3D projection among other things.
